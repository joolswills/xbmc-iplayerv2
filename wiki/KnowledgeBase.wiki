#summary Plugin Manual

= Plugin Installation =

To install this software please follow the [http://xbmc.org/wiki/?title=HOW-TO_install_and_use_plugins_in_XBMC XBMC plugin installation instructions]

= Plugin Limitations =

 * This plugin doesn't work outside of the UK. The BBC IPlayer website ensures that only UK IP address can access IPlayer content.

 * For Windows and Linux users some of the Radio streams don't work. XBMC on Windows and Linux does not support the rtsp:// protocol which is needed by some of the catchup and live radio stream.

 * This plugin doesn't yet support the Flash H.264 streams. This is a limitation of XBMC and hopefully will be fixed sometime soon.

 * This plugin doesn't yet support the Flash AAC radio streams. This is a limitation of XBMC and hopefully will be fixed sometime soon.
